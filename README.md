-First of all you need the TARGET_INFO_DROP_SYSTEM for just the drops !!
- I heard from some people that the old Tutorial from Chriss dont work right for them and they got many compiler errors.
- So i installed the system in my MartySama 5.8 Source (latest patch) and fixed it with some changes.
- Should work with other Files too

- If you got any Errors or something just let me know


- FULL CODE FROM @Chrissulici IS INCLUDED!
